New Pants for Christmas
~ Brann Rafferty

In halls decked with holly, and trees all a-glow,
I feasted on goodies, let my inhibitions go,
From gingerbread houses to mulled wine so bold,
I consumed with abandon, in holiday's hold.

Eggnog flowed like a river, a creamy delight,
Pies disappeared faster than stars in the night,
Turkey and stuffing, and oh, the mince pies,
I ate 'til I felt like a stuffed Christmas prize.

Dear Santa, I plead, as the scale gives a sigh,
Bring stretchy new pants and don't ask me why,
For I've eaten like royalty, bursting at seams,
Now I need new attire, for my dining regimes.

So here's to the feasting, our holiday rite,
Merry Christmas to all, let's eat day and night,
With waistbands expanded and spirits held high,
May your holidays be filled with joy and pie!
